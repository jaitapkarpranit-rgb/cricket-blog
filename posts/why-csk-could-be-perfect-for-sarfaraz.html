      Some players don’t fail because they lack talent.
      They fail because the system never quite knows what to do with them.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sarfaraz Khan is one of those cricketers Indian fans argue about every season —
      and not without reason. Since 2019, he has piled up mountainous Ranji Trophy numbers:
      seasons averaging over 90, double hundreds scored with alarming regularity, and
      an ability to dominate bowling attacks across conditions.
    </p>

    <p>
      In red-ball cricket, his name sits comfortably among the most consistent
      run-makers in the country. Yet, switch to the IPL, and the story flips.
    </p>

    <p>
      Across franchises and seasons, Sarfaraz has largely been reduced to bit-part roles —
      shuffled between positions, in and out of the XI, expected to deliver instant impact
      in formats and situations that never matched his strengths.
    </p>

    <p>
      One game he’s asked to anchor. The next, to slog from ball one.
      More often than not, he’s watching from the bench while the debate around him grows louder.
    </p>

    <p>
      Is he a middle-order stabiliser?<br>
      A spin-basher?<br>
      A Test specialist trapped in a T20 world?
    </p>

    <p>
      No franchise has ever answered that clearly.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      Talent rarely disappears. It usually just waits for clarity.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Now imagine him walking into Chennai Super Kings — a team that has built its reputation
      by doing the unfashionable thing: trusting numbers over noise, backing players beyond
      short-term failures, and valuing role clarity over raw hype.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is the same environment that has turned discarded players into match-winners
      and extended careers others had quietly written off.
    </p>

    <p>
      Suddenly, the question isn’t <em>“Is Sarfaraz good enough?”</em><br>
      The domestic record answered that long ago.
    </p>

    <p>
      It’s <em>“Has he finally landed in the right place?”</em>
    </p>
