      Cricket coverage today is louder than ever,
      yet it explains less than it ever has.
    </p>

    <p>
      Panels shout, graphics flash, and narratives
      are manufactured in real time — often before
      a ball has even landed.
    </p>

    <p>
      What’s missing is thinking. Calm. Context.
      The ability to say “this moment doesn’t need
      drama — it needs understanding.”
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      Noise fills time. Insight fills understanding.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      When everything is framed as urgent,
      nothing feels important anymore.
    </p>

    <p>
      Cricket doesn’t need more voices.
      It needs better ones.
