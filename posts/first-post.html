  <h1>Welcome to My Cricket Blog</h1>
  <p class="date">🗓 28 Dec 2025 · Category: Editorial</p>

  <p>
    This blog exists because modern cricket coverage is loud,
    rushed and shallow. Here, we slow things down.
  </p>

  <p>
    No hot takes. No manufactured outrage. Just thoughtful
    cricket writing for people who respect the game.
